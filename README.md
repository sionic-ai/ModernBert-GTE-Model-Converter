# ModernBert-GTE Model Converter

A tool for manual conversion of ModernBert-GTE models with preserved trainable variables and direct control over model outputs.

## Features

- Manual conversion of ModernBert-GTE models with preserved model architecture
- Direct control over model outputs (colbert, sparse, etc.)
- Resolution for ONNX conversion failures
- Solution for protobuf 2GB file size limitation
- Preservation of trainable variable information in the model structure

## Project Structure

```
├── ModernGTETFModel.py            # Model architecture definition
├── ModernGTETFWeightConverter.py  # Weight conversion and saving implementation
└── model_conversion_validator.py  # Conversion validation code
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Virtual environment
- Git LFS
- transformers==4.47.1
- keras==3.7.0
- tensorflow==2.16.2

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sionic-ai/ModernBert-GET-Model-Converter
cd /ModernBert-GET-Model-Converter
```

2. Set up Python virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
uv sync
# uv add -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Convert the model weights:
```bash
uv run ModernGTETFWeightConverter.py
```

2. Validate the converted model:
```bash
uv run model_conversion_validator.py
```

## Model Architecture

The converter works with XLMRobertaModel architecture with the following specifications:

- Hidden size: 1024
- Attention heads: 16
- Hidden layers: 24
- Maximum position embeddings: 8194
- Intermediate size: 4096
- Vocabulary size: 250002

## Input/Output Example

```

Encoder Layer 24:
PyTorch shape: torch.Size([2, 11, 1024])
    dims: [batch_size=2, seq_len=11, hidden_dim=1024]
TensorFlow shape: (2, 11, 1024)
    dims: [batch_size=2, seq_len=11, hidden_dim=1024]
  -> MSE: 0.000000
  -> CLS Token Cosine Similarity: 1.000000
[TensorFlow] Final Embeddings Shape: (2, 1024)
